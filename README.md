# Michael-Jordan-biography

This is my first project in HTML as a new programmer, this is just a biography of professional all-star player, Michael Jordan

This repository will be maintained with 2-3 commits a day for about a month.
This project is not an official web page, this is for gaining experience and learning to code while sharing it to the world.
