    Jordan's father, James, introduced him to baseball and built a basketball court in their backyard. James was murdered
    in the summer of 1993 when two teenagers shot him in his car in an apparent robbery as he was driving from Charlotte
    to Wilmington, North Carolina. He went missing for 11 days until his body was found in a swamp in McColl, South Carolina.
    The teens were later tried and convicted of the crime and received life sentences for first-degree murder.
